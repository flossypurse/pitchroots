      <p>
        PitchRoots is a Canada-wide soccer news feed. It answers one question:{" "}
        <em>what&apos;s happening in Canadian soccer today?</em> — across the national
        teams, the Canadian Premier League, the Northern Super League, Canada&apos;s MLS
        clubs, League1, and the provincial game.

        Every item is a headline, a short summary written in our own words, and a link
        to the original publisher. We are a router, not a destination: the full story
        always lives with the source, and we send you there.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-lg pt-2">How it works</h2>
      <p>
        The feed checks a curated list of Canadian soccer sources every hour — national
        media, league sites, independent outlets, and club news. Items are filtered for
        Canadian relevance, tagged, and summarized. There are no accounts and no
        paywall; read it on the site or subscribe by{" "}
        <a href="/feed.xml" className="text-pitch underline">RSS</a>.

      <p>
        The feed rebuilds itself every hour with a durable workflow — a live example of{" "}

        durable execution running inside the database, with no separate workflow
